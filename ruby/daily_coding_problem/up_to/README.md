# Up to

## First part

Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.

For example, given `[10, 15, 3, 7]` and `k` of `17`, return `true` since 10 + 7 is 17.
For example, given `[1, 5, 4, 10, 100, 2]` and `k` of `17`, return `false` since no one sums 17.

## Second part

Can you do this in one pass?

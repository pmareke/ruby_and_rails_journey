The heart of Hotwire is Turbo. A set of complementary techniques for speeding
up page changes and form submissions, dividing complex pages into components,
and stream partial page updates over WebSocket.

## [Stimulus](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev)

While Turbo usually takes care of at least 80% of the interactivity that
traditionally would have required JavaScript, there are still cases where
a dash of custom code is required. Stimulus makes this easy with a HTML-centric
approach to state and wiring.

Standardizes the way that web and native parts of a mobile hybrid application 
talk to each other via HTML bridge attributes.

# [The Rails Doctrine](https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine)

Here follows **the nine most important pillars** of The Rails Doctrine

## Optimize for programmer happiness

- Ruby’s original heresy was indeed to place the happiness of the programmer on a pedestal.
- The Principle of The Bigger Smile: APIs designed with great attention paid to whatever would make me smile more and broader.
- Optimizing for happiness is perhaps the most formative key to Ruby on Rails. It shall remain such going forward.
 
## Convention over Configuration

- The power of good conventions is that they pay dividends across a wide spectrum of use.
- Constraints liberate even the most able minds.
 
## The menu is omakase

- A way to eat well that requires you neither be an expert in the cuisine nor blessed with blind luck at picking in the dark.
- Where CoC is occupied with how we best use individual frameworks, omakase is concerned with which frameworks, and how they fit together.
 
## No one paradigm

- To be so ideologically flexible is what enables Rails to tackle such a wide array of problems.
- The way to alleviate some of that learning burden is to simply just make it easy to get started.

## Exalt beautiful code

- In Ruby, it’s often somewhere at the intersection between native Ruby idioms and the power of a custom domain-specific language.
- Sometimes it’s less about making something as short or powerful as possible, but more about making the rhythm of the declaration flow.
 
## Provide sharp knives

- Ruby includes a lot of sharp knives in its drawer of features. Not by accident, but by design.
- There’s nothing programmatically in Ruby to stop you using its sharp knives to cut ties with reason.
- The language flourished exactly because it offered a different and radical perspective on the role of the programmer: That they could be trusted with sharp knives.
- Ruby on Rails is an environment for chefs and those who wish to become chefs.
- You might start out doing the dishes, but you can work your way up to running the kitchen.
   
## Value integrated systems

- Rails can be used in many contexts, but nothing like a whole system that addresses an entire problem.
 
## Progress over stability

- When systems have been around for more than a decade, like Rails has, their natural tendency is towards ossification.
- Bundler was once a controversial idea, but through Rails’ insistence that it be a cornerstone of a shared future, it’s today just taken for granted.
- Progress is ultimately mostly about people and their willingness to push change.
 
## Push up a big tent

- Rails is capable of supporting such a large community under one tent exactly because there are so few if any litmus tests.
- Having a big tent doesn’t mean trying to be all things to all people, though. It just means you welcome all people to your party, and allow them to bring their own drinks.
